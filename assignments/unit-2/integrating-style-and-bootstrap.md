# Assignment: Incorporating styling & Bootstrap into your site

Remember the syllabus contains useful links for this unit that may aid you  in the below tasks.

## Overview
For this assignment, you'll be:
 
* Updating your website to use Bootstrap 4
* Adding additional styling to your site
* Writing SASS to customize either Bootstrap styling or your own styling
* Creating a README file


## Website

### Concept
Most websites are intended to look good. Yours from assignment 1, unless you worked ahead, probably does not. It's still a website, but we can improve the User Experience (_UX_) on the site through an improved User Interface (_UI_). There are a _lot_ of existing CSS/HTML frameworks out there, such as Bootstrap, Material, Bourbon, and a whole lot more. For this assignment, you're required to use Bootstrap 4.  

Before getting started on the requirements themselves, I recommend jumping directly into the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/). Additionally, you will _probably_ find this task easier by downloading the [Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/starter-template/) and copying your HTML into that template. 

**Important:** These pages are public, so be sure to only write what you feel comfortable being public to the world.

### Requirements
1. Each page:
    1. **[Major]** Page header must implement responsive/collapsible menu
    1. Page content must use Bootstrap's `.container` so its width is limited
    1. Must have at least 1 image and each image must be responsive
    1. Must utilize the Bootstrap grid system in some way
    1. Page footer must have a different background color than the rest of the page that spans 100% width
1. Other requirements
    1. At least one page must have a full-width hero
    1. Must have at least 3 pages per teammate including form page (see below)
    1. All pages should be found in the page header menu
        * Pro-tip: Many sites have another navigation of key pages in the footer. Consider adding one to yours if it makes sense.
    1. **[Major]** Use at least 3 _different_ components listed in <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components>
        * Be sure to list these in your README.txt or README.md file so I know which ones to look for during grading!
    1. Add a README.md or README.txt file with your team member names and any additional information that is relevant to the assignment or project
1. Form page requirements
    1. You should have a page with a form on it. It can be a contact form, a newsletter subscribe form, or something else entirely.
    1. The form page has the same requirements as the other pages, too! 
    1. The form must have at least 3 different types of inputs (such as text, email, phone, radio, textarea, select, etc.)
    1. The form must have a submit button
    1. **The form does not and should not yet work**, but it should be present
    1. Have some content on the page with the form
    1. The form should utilize the Bootstrap grid system
    1. Add two Bootstrap Alert components to your form:
        1. One is a success (`.alert-success`) alert that shows the form submission is successful
        1. One is an error (`.alert-danger`) alert that shows the form submission failed
1. SASS requirements
    1. Option A:
        1. **[Major]** You should add your own styles using SASS
            1. You have complete freedom with your creativity. Do what you like!  
        1. **[Major]** You should at minimum use nested tags
        1. Try to use at least one mix-in or function
        1. **[Major]** You must use define and use at least 2 variables 
        1. **[Major]** You must have at _least_ 20 CSS rules  
        1. **[Major]** Your SASS compiles and you have a generated CSS stylesheet 
        1. **[Major]** Your custom CSS stylesheet is embedded into the page
    2. Option B: 
        1. **[Major]** Customize the Bootstrap build and regenerate the build locally rather than downloading/sourcing compiled assets. See <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/> for help

## GitHub Pages Steps

1. Make sure your git repository is already on GitHub
1. Visit <https://pages.github.com/>
1. You should choose a _project site_ for this option. You are welcome to later convert this site to a _user site_.
1. For this assignment, you _must_ choose "start from scratch" and _not_ "Choose a theme", as the idea here is to demonstrate your understanding of the components learned in this course. 
1. Follow the instructions on the page.

## Grading and Rubric
