# Assignment: Building and deploying your first website with git and GitHub
  
Remember the syllabus contains useful links for this unit that may aid you  in the below tasks.

## Overview
For this assignment, you'll be:
 
* Creating a website using basic HTML
* Tracking your changes and source code with a version control system (vcs) called _git_
* Deploying your git _repository_ to an online _remote_ called _GitHub (Classroom)_, which is a _Software as a Service_ (SaaS) 
    * Arguably, GitHub is and/or a _Platform as a Service_ (PaaS)
* Creating a project site for your repository using _GitHub Pages_, which is a PaaS

## Website

### Concept
Your website can be on anything you like that is "school appropriate." If you don't have an online portfolio yet to showcase the items you have built/are building during your college career (including other professional and freelance items you make), I recommend creating that. If you have that already, or are not interested in doing that, choose a topic you are interested in such as a favorite show, a hobby, something you disdain but want to write about (remember, school appropriate), etc. It's _your_ website, make what you want! 

You should note, however, that we'll be updating this page throughout the semester, so pick something you will want to work on for the next 8 weeks.   

**Important:** These pages are public, so be sure to only write what you feel comfortable being public to the world.

### Requirements
1. **[Major]** Must have at _least_ 2 pages (per teammate) that are linked together using hyperlinks
1. Each page:
    1. Must have header with a menu that shows all pages
    1. Must have at least one image
    1. Must have at least 1 `<h1>` tag
    1. Must have at least 1 `<h2>` tag
    1. Must have at least 1 `<h3>` tag
    1. Must have at least one ordered or unordered list
    1. Must have at least 2 paragraphs of text
    1. Must have a footer with a copyright and any other relevant information
        * Your name must appear in the footer somewhere.
    1. Must use semantic HTML

## GitHub Pages Steps

1. Make sure your git repository is already on GitHub
1. Ensure you have committed and pushed at least one file to the GitHub repository (remote) 
1. Visit <https://pages.github.com/>
1. You should choose a _project site_ for this option. You are welcome to later convert this site to a _user site_.
1. For this assignment, you _must_ choose "start from scratch" and _not_ "Choose a theme", as the idea here is to demonstrate your understanding of the components learned in this course
1. Follow the instructions on the page

## Git Requirements

Your git repository should have at _least_ 3 commits. Realistically, a site would probably have hundreds by the time it goes live. Remember that commits are small, granular updates.


## Grading and Rubric

This assignment is due at the end of Unit 1. It is worth 100 points. Submit the GitHub Page URL **and** the GitHub repository URL via the assignment link in Sakai. 

* 100/100 - Website and git requirements are met. Website is available on GitHub pages
* 90/100 - Website is available on GitHub Pages and is missing only a couple non-major components
* 75/100 - Website is available on GitHub Pages and is missing a major or several components
* 50/100 - Website is not available on GitHub Pages or misses many components
* 0/100 - No or little attempt
