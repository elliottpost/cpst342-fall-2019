# Final Project

## Introduction
Your final project is intended to be demonstrate your mastery of the basics learned in this course. To demonstrate this, you have two choices for your final project. Both are listed below and both have similar requirements. 

Keep in mind your final project is worth 25% of your final grade and you are given the details for it with more than half the class remaining. To earn all 25%, it is expected that you will start working on the final project by week 5 and continue working on it for the rest of the semester.

## Option A
Create a new project unrelated to the assignments in units 1-4 but still related to the overall learning objectives of this course. Your project should show an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use React, Angular, PhaserJS, or any JavaScript library or framework of your choice. Your application must still meet specific requirements as enumerated below. Ultimately, you have complete flexibility with this project but must prove that you understand core web application development principles and demonstrate the ability to use various web application development tools. Feel free to take the basics you learn in this class to the next level by teaching yourself a new tool like MochaJS and creating unit tests for a series of simple pages you create. You could also try learning something like TravisCI and implementing some sort of complete workflow for end-to-end development and testing of a web application.

## Option B
Using unit 3 or unit 4 assignment as a base, extend the application to create a new _substantial_ feature or multiple smaller features. There's no exact rule here, just make sure you feel the work you're doing is worth 25% of your overall course grade and ask the instructor when in doubt.

### Option B Examples

1. Add a database component to your application to replace hard-coded content. 
1. Adapt your application to connect to a content management system like WordPress using RESTful API commands to dynamically load the content. 
1. Use RESTful APIs from existing 3rd party applications to integrate some form of data or utilities into your your site.
1. Update the assignment/project-base to be a portfolio for your work as a student at Loyola and add pages for each item in your portfolio as well as the portfolio archive showing all items itself. You may wish to add an infinite scroll if you have a lot of items and load them dynamically as the user scrolls, rather than loading all at once. 
1. Add an interactive component for the user such as some sort of game or calculator that takes user input and gives relevant responses.
1. There are an infinite number of examples, but choose something _you_ are interested in doing to make your project fun for you to build and interesting to demonstrate to others.
1. Create some sort of JavaScript based rudimentary AI (like a Slackbot) which sends commands to your web application and receives data and displays it to the user.

## General Requirements
There is no _complete_ set of requirements every project must meet. Each project is different and giving you a set of checkboxes to tick often blocks creativity; however, all projects should meet as many of the below items as possible/relevant or replace them with something similar. If you have any doubt or question, please post the question to Piazza or email the instructor for clarification. That said, see _Core Requirements_ below which represent the bare _minimum_ every project must meet.

### Core Requirements
1. Use HTML, CSS/SASS, and JS effectively.
1. Use tools like npm or yarn to add dependencies to your project, or gulp as a task runner.
1. Use git and GitHub for version control.
1. Deploy your application online via GitHub Pages, Zeit's now.sh, Heroku, or some other web host of your choice.

## Timeline

* Week 2: Project Announced
* Week 3: Project Details Released
* Weeks 4-5: Students create teams (sized 1-3) and plan out project. Create a 1-2 page document (proposal) detailing your project goals and how you intend to achieve them
* Week 5: Teams schedule 15 minute meetings to check-in privately with the instructor to discuss project plan
* Week 6: Thanksgiving Break - no classes, but you should be starting development on your project
* Week 7: Optional project check-ins for 1-on-1 help
* Week 8: Projects due. Record presentation and publish to Pizza. Perform peer review on classmates' presentations 

## Presentation & Peer Review Details
Between weeks 7-8, you’ll post a video presentation of your application to Piazza. During the final week you’ll watch and respond to 3 of your classmates presentations. Each student must review 3 projects, even if you work as a team.

### Presentation Requirements

1. 5-10 minutes in length.
1. Give an overview of the application and demo the application.
1. Discuss what you found challenging and what was the most fun to work on/what was an interesting problem to solve, etc.
1. Do not show 100% of the code for your application as you will not have time in a short 5-10 minute presentation do that effectively.
1. You can show code snippets that are relevant to the discussion.
1. Feel free to share source code with students who would like it, after all projects are submitted.
1. You do not need to use powerpoint or anything like that, but you are welcome to if you choose.
1. Record your presentation using your own Zoom line (see syllabus for details), then post your recording to YouTube or Box.com, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc, and share the link. Your link should be public, meaning a user does not need to sign in to see it, but the link can be unlisted meaning it will not show up in YouTube or Google search results/
1. Post your presentation to Pizza with the subject of your team name + final project name. Be sure to tag it as "project" so it can be found easily by your peers.

## Rubric

* 10% - Project proposal & initial check-in.
* 25% - Difficulty level. How much did you challenge yourself?
* 25% - Implementation. Ensure your application works flawlessly and does what you stated it would.
* 10% - Code style. Write legible code and ensure you're following some form of standard.
* 15% - Presentation. Prepare and record a presentation for your project. 
* 15% - Peer feedback. Review classmates' projects and provide constructive feedback.

### Grading Breakdown

Like most grading, it is subjective; however, all projects will be graded against the following criteria

#### Project proposal/initial Check-in.

- 10/10 (A) - Proposal is detailed and shows an effort went into making it. Student shows up for check-in.
- 8/10 (C) - Proposal shows some detail but doesn't effectively convey what the application will do or how the student will meet the goals. Student shows up for check-in.
- 5/10 (F) - Proposal has some attempt made but is very basic or unclear, or student fails to show up for the check-in.
- 0-5/10 (F) - Little to no effort is made on proposal.

#### Difficulty level

- 25/25 (A) - Student(s) clearly and significantly challenge themselves by learning one or more new tools/libraries/frameworks/etc and/or by having complex functionality and/or design on the application itself. 
- 22/25 (B) - Student(s) clearly and mostly challenge themselves by learning one and/or more new tools/libraries/frameworks/etc or by having complex functionality and/or design on the application itself. 
- 19/25 (C) - Student(s) met basic requirements by using only tools learned in the course and/or by having an application with basic functionality and/or design.
- 5/25 (F) - Student(s) demonstrated little or no effort to challenge themselves.

#### Implementation
- 25/25 (A) - Project works flawlessly and meets the functionality described in the proposal.
- 22/25 (B) - Project works well and/or meets most of the functionality described in the proposal.
- 19/25 (C) - Project has obvious issues but still meets most of the functionality described in the proposal.
- 12.5/25 (F) - Project has major issues or doesn't meet most of the functionality but students demonstrate a genuine effort.
- 0/25 (F) - Students demonstrate little to no effort in project.

#### Code Style 
- 10/10 (A) - Code is legible and easy to read. Variables, functions, classes, etc, have a consistent formatting. Consistent use of indentation. Code is commented.
- 8/10 (C) - Code meets most of the items for 10/10 score.
- 5/10 (F) - Code meets a couple of the items for 10/10 score.
- 0/10 (F) - Little to no effort is made for styling.

#### Presentation
- 15/15 (A) - Presentation is within time limits as well as describes and demonstrates well the project.
- 13/15 (B) - Presentation is mostly within time limits as well as describes and demonstrates adequately the project.
